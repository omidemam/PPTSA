## 🌧️ Overview

This repository presents a **probabilistic time-series analysis of precipitation**, focusing on the statistical structure, impulse-like behavior, and predictability of rainfall.

Using **140 years of daily precipitation data from Central Park, New York City**, the project combines:

- Frequency-domain analysis  
- Classical stochastic models  
- Point-process formulations  
- Deep learning approaches  
- Probabilistic uncertainty quantification  

The goal is to **understand precipitation dynamics**, assess **forecasting limits**, and **explicitly characterize uncertainty**, particularly in the presence of intermittent and impulsive rainfall events.

## 🔬 Methods & Modeling Framework

The repository implements and compares the following approaches:

- **Frequency Domain Analysis**  
  Identifies periodicity (or lack thereof) and highlights challenges introduced by impulse-like precipitation patterns.

- **ARIMAX / SARIMAX Models**  
  Captures trends and conditional dependencies using classical time-series models with exogenous variables.

- **Marked Point Process (MPP)**  
  Models precipitation as an impulse-driven stochastic process, offering physical and statistical intuition beyond Gaussian assumptions.

- **LSTM Neural Networks**  
  Learns temporal dependencies among multiple meteorological variables using tuned deep recurrent architectures.

- **Gaussian Process (GP) Residual Modeling**  
  Quantifies predictive uncertainty by modeling LSTM residuals probabilistically.

---

## 📊 Key Findings (High Level)

- Precipitation exhibits **no strong periodicity**, complicating frequency-based forecasting.
- **ARIMAX/SARIMAX** effectively captures long-term trends but struggles with impulses.
- **Marked Point Processes** provide interpretability for impulse-like rainfall events.
- **LSTM models** capture trends but show limited accuracy for exact daily values.
- **Gaussian Processes** accurately model residual uncertainty, improving probabilistic predictions.
